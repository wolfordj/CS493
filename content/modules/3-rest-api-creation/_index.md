## Introduction
<!--- Introduce the topic in this section -->
This module is designed to walk you through making a basic rest API. It will show you how to specifically use Node.js and Google App Engine with the Cloud Datastore to make a REST API running on the cloud.

## Key Questions
- What are good URLs to use in a REST API?
- How are routes set up in Google App Engine?
- What are some key differences between accessing items in the Datastore and SQL?


## Assignment Overview
This week you will lay the framework for a basic REST API. You will need to implement a basic two entity API where the two items can be related. Future assignments will build off of this one.

## Review
The key for this module is to get a good understanding of the fundamentals of a REST API. You should understand how to do the CRUD operations on a single entity and should have spend some time considering and implementing possible solutions to related entities. In later modules we will talk about some more best practices and advanced functionality. But for now you should have a pretty good understanding of the basic operations.
