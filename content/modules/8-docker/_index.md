## Introduction
<!--- Introduce the topic in this section -->
Containerization is a modern computing paradigm in which application software is run within an environment that is virtualized at the operating system level.

## Key Questions
- What are the use cases for a tool like Docker?
- What is the difference between containers and virtual machines?
- How can you set up and deploy a container to a cloud provider?

## Additional Resources
[Getting Started With Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
: Here is the official getting started documentation for Docker. It is not the most accessible, but for completeness's sake, here it is. If the class material is not sufficient you might want to just search for some getting started guides.

## Review
This should get you started with the basics of Docker. There is far more you can do with it than what you have seen here, but this should be a good foundation with which to get some projects started and get some experience using the platform.
