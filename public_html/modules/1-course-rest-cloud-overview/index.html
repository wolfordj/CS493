<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<!--- Introduce the topic in this section -->

<p>Welcome to Cloud application development. This module will give you a basic overview of the class, go over some basic cloud topics and give you some time to focus on making sure you can get the required tools set up and working before there is any serious homework to be done.</p>

<h2 id="key-questions">Key Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>What is cloud computing?</li>
<li>What are the recommending tools and software to be used in this class?</li>
<li>What does the general course workload look like?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assignment-overview">Assignment Overview</h2>

<!--- Give a general overview of the sort of assignment(s) students will do during the week -->

<p>The assignment this week involves a very minimal amount of writing code. Instead you are tasked with getting some basic hello world applications up and running to prove both to yourself and the instructor that your computer and accounts are set up to let you be successful in this course.</p>

<h2 id="explore-the-topics">Explore the Topics</h2>

<!--- An automatically generated list of explore topics from the same directory as this overview. Generated from the frontmatter, make sure to fill in the title, description and include "Exploration" in the categories! -->

    <dd>
       This will help you get oriented in the course. You should get an idea of what will be covered and what the general workload for the course will look like.

    <dd>
       This will give you an overview of what we mean when we talk about cloud computing in this course. It is a bit of a fuzzy definition, but we will do our best and then look at some more specific terms.
    </dd>
    
    <dt><a href="http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/perpetual/cs493-400/modules/1-course-rest-cloud-overview/3-api-overview/">API Introduction</a></dt>
    <dd>
       This is designed to get you familiar with the idea of an API which is basically a software service without a UI that other programmers can use.

    <dt><a href="http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/perpetual/cs493-400/modules/1-course-rest-cloud-overview/4-tools-setup/">Tools and Software Setup</a></dt>
    <dd>
       This will help you get oriented with the tools that we will be using throughout the class. It is important to get these set up early and see if there are any roadblocks that might keep you from being successful in the future portions of this class.

<dd>This is the tool you will probably want to use to interact with APIs that don&rsquo;t otherwise provide a GUI. It makes it easier to send requests, set up payloads and view responses. It can also handle sending OAuth tokens.</dd>

<dd>This is a link to the documentation for the Google App Engine Node.js Standard Environment. It is one of two options for the platforms supported in this class.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/">Google App Engine Python Standard Environment</a></dt>
<dd>This is a link to the documentation for the Google App Engine Python 3 Standard environment. It is the other option for platforms supported in this class.</dd>

<h2 id="review">Review</h2>

<p>After this week you should be confident that you have all the software set up and the accounts you need in order to interact with APIs as well as host your own API that others can access. There isn&rsquo;t a whole lot of content that you need to learn this week. This is intentional to make sure you have time to get everything set up and working. For some folks this may be a 20 minute process, others may run into technical issues that take some time to debug. Make sure to use this week to get that debugging done.</p>
